<h3 align="center">Project 1: Movie Trailer Website</h3>

This is the first project for Udacity's Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. The goal is to write server-side code that will then be served to a client facing web application.

I used The Movie DB API to get top rated movies, parsed the JSON, grabed the relevant information, and used it to populate the Front-End Web Application. In this Web Application the user is expected to be able to see the Title and Movie poster of each individual movie. When the user clicks on the Movie poster, the web application will play the relevant movie trailer.


## Quick start

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sonnyochoa/MovieTrailerWebsite.git`
- Register for an API Key with [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- Replace config.API_KEY in the entertainment_center.py file with the API Key you received from TMDB.
- Once everything is configured, to run the web application you need to run entertainment_center.py: `python entertainment_center.py`
